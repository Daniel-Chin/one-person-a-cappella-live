voice timbre + volume = harmonics countour
Base: "impulse train" in the freq domain. Strict harmos, mag = 1. 

linear interp on log or not? 
    can't hear a difference. Using no-log

Try: 
    don't implement vibrato
    Sing with vibrato
    see what you get

implement vibrato?
    no?

hybrid synth
    low freq: harmoSynth
    high freq: ifftSynth
    
    to test:
        the output multiplier. Synth the same pitch with ifft and harmo: are they at the same level? 

TODO

"with a periodic signal for voiced sounds and white noise for unvoiced sounds. "
    - Ning Hu
    YinYin! Take out the harmonics. Use the rest to synth the envloped noise. 
    test this in jupyter notebook with a pre-recorded "mouthhh fffrequencccccy"

Spectral leakage: just sum the neiboring freq bins? 
    no. Sum is smaller when the freq is in the mid of a bin
    Sum of squares: look likes it! 
    So let's dump SFT

Why does the sound sound loose when in triad? 
    test adding sounds together in Jupyter. 
    maybe related to irrational harmonics not interfering?
